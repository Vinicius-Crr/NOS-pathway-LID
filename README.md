### Is there any influence of genetic variants of nitric oxide metabolism genes on the development of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease?
Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) is a common complication in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), and its prevalence is such that several studies trying to elucidate its development have been carried out in recent years. Yet their pathogenesis remains elusive. This project addresses the pressing need for a deeper understanding of LID development by conducting a focused genetic analysis. Our primary goal is to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of LID, concentrating on the potential between nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. Specifically, we aim to unravel the genetic cascade governing NO metabolism within the central nervous system, a pathway implicated in LID pathophysiology (PMID: 19302833; 25553372). We plan to use the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), a tool with annotated genetic sets for gene set enrichment analyses to select the candidate genes related to the NO cascade. Additionally, we intend to conduct a brief literature review that may add new genes to the analysis. Through variant analysis of genes involved in NO metabolism, we endeavor to uncover variants associated with LID development. We will employ logistic regression modeling to discern significant genetic associations with LID development to achieve this.

### Why this project matters
This project has a significant impact as it aims to deepen our understanding of the
genetic factors contributing to LID development. By identifying specific genetic markers,
we can predict individual patients' risk of developing LID, enabling early intervention to
improve their quality of life. Additionally, this research may lead to the development of
targeted therapies, ultimately enhancing treatment outcomes for Parkinson's disease
patients. The project stands out due to its focus on the genetics of the nitric oxide signaling
pathway, an area that has yet to be extensively explored in relation to LID. It stems from
consistent biological plausibility built by the previous work of Dr. Tumas (PMID:
19302833; 25553372; 34940921; 21088802). This targeted investigation represents a
solid differentiator, potentially uncovering new insights into LID development. By
concentrating on this promising gene, we aim to provide valuable contributions to clarify
the factors involved in developing the LID.
